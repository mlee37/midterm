I downloaded data from iNaturalist.com. I chose only observations in Wyoming and only research-grade observations to narrow down the amount of data I was working with. I chose to download data for two species, the North American River Otter and the North American Beaver. I chose these species because they are both native, semi-aquatic mammals. They occupy similar habitats, although beavers can be found in marshier habitat and at higher elevations than river otters. I chose not to represent muskrats, another semi-aquatic mammal, because they are not considered keystone or ecosystem engineer species like river otters and beavers are. 

For the analysis, I chose to do a heat map because this is the one analysis that we have done in the class so far, but also becaues there are interesting spatial concentrations of the observations of both of these species in Wyoming. Both observations are concentrated in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, but that doesn't necessarily mean that both of these animals occur at higher densities in this region than in other areas of Wyoming. Because my data source is iNaturalist, data that is submitted is opportunistic rather than via structured surveys, and depends on an active user base. Because a lot of tourists visit this region, it makes sense that there is a high density of obsevations from this area.
